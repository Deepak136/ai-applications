## AI approaches

[Back to Top](#contents)

| [Workshop](https://sfi-edu.s3.amazonaws.com/sfi-edu/production/uploads/sfi-com/dev/uploads/filer/e2/09/e209cc8c-1ddc-4f7e-beb5-d23fbe509302/93-08-052.pdf) | [logic-ai](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/logic-ai/) |

- **Symbolic AI(formal logic - (1950-1980)** - "If an otherwise healthy adult has a fever, then they may have influenza"
- **Bayesian inference(Statistical AI)** - "If the current patient has a fever, adjust the probability they have influenza in such-and-such way"
- **Machine learning and data mining** - "After examining the records of known past patients whose temperature, symptoms, age, and other factors mostly match the current patient, X% of those patients turned out to have influenza"
- **Artificial Neural Network** - inspired by how the brain's machinery works(neurons).
- **Evolutionary AI** - uses mechanisms inspired by biological evolution, such as reproduction, mutation, recombination, and natural selection.

*Note: But not only above five(extremely hyped and popular in routine business AI applications), researchers trying different approaches to achieve general AI*

<blockquote>
There is no established unifying theory or paradigm that guides AI research. Researchers disagree about many issues. A few of the most long standing questions that have remained unanswered are these: should artificial intelligence simulate natural intelligence by studying psychology or neurobiology? Or is human biology as irrelevant to AI research as bird biology is to aeronautical engineering? Can intelligent behavior be described using simple, elegant principles (such as logic or optimization)? Or does it necessarily require solving a large number of completely unrelated problems?

> What is the difference between data mining, statistics, machine learning and AI? 
> Would it be accurate to say that they are 4 fields attempting to solve very similar problems but with different approaches? What exactly do they have in common and where do they differ? If there is some kind of hierarchy between them, what would it be?


<p>In short</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Statistics</strong> <em>quantifies</em> numbers</li>
<li><strong>Data Mining</strong> <em>explains</em> patterns</li>
<li><strong>Machine Learning</strong> <em>predicts</em> with models</li>
<li><strong>Artificial Intelligence</strong> <em>behaves</em> and <em>reasons</em></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Statistics</strong> is just about the numbers, and quantifying the data.  There are many tools for finding relevant properties of the data but this is pretty close to pure mathematics.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Data Mining</strong> is about using <strong>Statistics</strong> as well as other programming methods to find patterns hidden in the data so that you can <em>explain</em> some phenomenon. Data Mining builds intuition about what is really happening in some data and is still little more towards math than programming, but uses both.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Machine Learning</strong> uses <strong>Data Mining</strong> techniques and other learning algorithms to build models of what is happening behind some data so that it can <em>predict</em> future outcomes. Math is the basis for many of the algorithms, but this is more towards programming.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Artificial Intelligence</strong> uses models built by <strong>Machine Learning</strong> and other ways to <em>reason</em> about the world and give rise to intelligent <em>behavior</em> whether this is playing a game or driving a robot/car. Artificial Intelligence has some goal to achieve by predicting how actions will affect the model of the world and chooses the actions that will best achieve that goal.  Very programming based.</p>

### Principles and Rules

[Back to Top](#contents)


- Principle of least priviledge - Requires that in a particular abstraction layer of a computing environment, every module (such as a process, a user, or a program, depending on the subject) must be able to access only the information and resources that are necessary for its legitimate purpose
- Peter principle - The selection of a candidate for a position is based on the candidate's performance in their current role, rather than on abilities relevant to the intended role
    + Employees only stop being promoted once they can no longer perform effectively, and "managers rise to the level of their incompetence."
- Pareto principle
    + 20% of the features will account for 80% of the value
    + 20% of the work will produce 80% of the value
- Ninety/Ninety Rule
    + The first 90 percent of the code accounts for the first 90 percent of the development time. The remaining 10 percent of the code accounts for the other 90 percent of the development time. (180% of time)
- SUCCESs - Made to stick principles
    + Simplicity
    + Unexpectedness
    + Concreteness
    + Credibility
    + Emotions
    + Stories
- Build, measure, learn
    + Maximize learning through incremental and iterative engineering
    + Build relates to MVP, ie, the simplest product to show customers to get most learning at that time
    + Goal is always to maximize learning and not build fully featured beta/prototype
    + Lean startup version: hypothesis, design experiments, test, insight

**Laws**
- Parkinson's law of triviality - Members of an organisation give disproportionate weight to trivial issues
- Parkinson's law - Work expands so as to fill the time available for its completion
- Brooks's law - Adding manpower to a late software project makes it later
- Hofstadter's law - It always takes longer than you expect, even when you take into account Hofstadter's Law
- Little's law - The long-term average number of customers in a stable system L is equal to the long-term average effective arrival rate, λ, multiplied by the (Palm‑)average time a customer spends in the system, W; or expressed algebraically: L = λW.

**Quotes, Idioms, and Sayings**

- Nothing is more permanent than a temporary solution
- The world doesn't need wrong answers in record time
- Work on the business, not in the business
- Fail to plan is to plan to fail
- Silence equals agreement
- Deliver results rather than excuses
- Don't prove own importance by vetoing good ideas and road-blocking productive work
- Accept total accountability and make it happen
- When making decisions, slower ultimate success is better than rapid permanent failure
- YAGNI (from XP) - You aren’t gonna need it
    + "Always implement things when you actually need them, never when you just foresee that you need them."
- DTSTTCPW (from XP) - "do the simplest thing that could possibly work"
- Skip blame and complain game and get things done despite major obstacles. Victim mentality is the kiss of death.
- KISS - Keep it simple, stupid
- A good plan implemented today is better than a perfect plan implemented tomorrow
- MLP - minimum lovable product
- A problem without a solution is a complaint
- Working on the right thing is as—if not more important—than how hard you are working
- You can’t have five North Stars, you can’t have five most important goals…
- Prioritize goals that are ‘critical’ ahead of goals that are ‘beneficial

**General terms, models, acronymns, and concepts**

[Back to Top](#contents)

- Priorities for business (in order)
    + People
    + Products
    + Profits
- Iron triangle success
    + Build MVP based on perceived value and market research with associated scope and let that choose the time and resources required
- GRIT
    + Generosity
    + Respect
    + Integrity
        * Accountability
    + Truth
- Give credit, don't take it
- The most effective way to solve any problem is to put together all of the people with the skills required to solve it, i.e., a cross-functional or multi-disciplinary team
- A startup is a temporary organization designed to search for a repeatable and scalable business model
- When people don’t take responsibility
    + Reputations decline
    + Timelines are extended
    + Performance falls short
    + Frustration shoots up
    + Goals are adapted
    + Accusation and blame escalates
    + Gossip soars. “What’s up with Fred? He never get’s things done on time.
    + Excuses abound. Irresponsible people give “good” reason for irresponsibility.
    + Higher ups complain
    + Stress increase
- Curse of knowledge
    + The curse of knowledge is a cognitive bias that leads better-informed parties to find it extremely difficult to think about problems from the perspective of lesser-informed parties
    + Aka the ‘tapper effect’ (2.5% guessed right), charades, etc.
- Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs
    + Self-actualization
    + Esteem
    + Love/belonging
    + Safety
    + Physiological
- Analysis paralysis
    + The state of over- analyzing (or over-thinking) a situation so that a decision or action is never taken, in effect paralyzing the outcome
- The paradox of choice
- SMART model for goals
    + S – Specific
    + M – Measurable
    + A – Achievable
    + R – Relevant
    + T – Time-boxed
- FURPS - Model for classifying software quality attributes
    + Functionality
    + Usability
    + Reliability
    + Performance
    + Supportability
- AAARR metrics for pirates
    + Acquisition
    + Activation
    + Retention
    + Referrals
    + Revenue
- MTMM - Metric that matters most
- Problem space vs solution space
    + Problem space - user benefit
        * A customer problem, need, or benefit that the product should address
        * A product requirement
    + Solution space - product
